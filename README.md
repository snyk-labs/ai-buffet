# AI Buffet

A buffet of AI examples across different languages. Each language lives in its own directory with its own README and setup.

This repo is meant to showcase the capabilities of our **ai-bom** tool by providing examples of AI usage—from simple chat and image generation to agents and transitive dependency detection.

## Languages

| Language     | Directory    | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Python**   | [python/](python/)   | Anthropic chatbot, melody generation; model usage and transitive AI dependency detection. |
| **TypeScript** | [typescript/](typescript/) | LangChain, Anthropic chatbot, OpenAI (SDK, raw fetch, streaming, images), agent with tools. |

See each directory’s README for setup and how to run the examples.
